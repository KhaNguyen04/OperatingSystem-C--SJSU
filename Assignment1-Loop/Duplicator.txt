Remember in school when you did something wrong, like chewed gum in class, you would have to write "I will not chew gum" 100 times. <br/>
Well, we are going to write a program to help with that. You need to write a program that takes a count as a command-line parameter. <br/
It will then read a line from stdin and write it to stdout that many times. For example: <br/>
<br/>
$ ./duplicator 3
i will not chew gum
i will not chew gum
i will not chew gum
i will not chew gum

For this assignment must be done in C. It will be graded on an Ubuntu (or Kubuntu) 20.04 system,   <br/>
so you are highly encouraged to use that to do your development and testing. To read from stdin, you will need to use getline(), <br/>
remember to pass NULL and 0 as the first two arguments so that the right amount of space will be automatically allocated to hold your line. <br/>
When you have finished with the line, remember to free() it. Note that the line includes the newline character, so you will probably want to remove that.<br/>

When you program finishes, it will exit with an exit code of 0.

# Error handling<br/>
If the count is less than or equal to zero, not provided, or not a number, print the message "USAGE: duplicator count\ncount must be an integer greater than 0\n" and exit with a code of 1. We can assume that a valid count will fit into an "int". 
# Example Tests<br/>
./duplicator 1<br/>
hello<br/>
./duplicator 2<br/>
line 1<br/>
line 2<br/>
line 3<br/>
line 4<br/>
line 5<br/>
./duplicator 3<br/>
i will not chew gum<br/>
this is easy<br/>
./duplicator 135<br/>
i will not chew gum<br/>
this is easy<br/>
./duplicator<br/>
